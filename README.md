# StreamingData-PowerBI
First you need to create a simple streaming data choosing **API** Option on PowerBI and using that steaming dataset you have to create a dashboard on Power BI containing three simple tiles.

Visualization Type of those 3 tiles should be:
1. *Card*
2. *Guage*
3. *Line Chart*

After that you need to run these code in Visual Studio:
1. *program.cs*
2. *class.cs*

Make sure to update the **"Values"** and **"powerBiUrl"**.

BOOM! Your Real-time Dashboard is ready. Enjoy!!
